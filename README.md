# Sleep Coach – Predicting Academic Performance Based on Sleep Patterns

Overview

Develop a model that serves as a virtual sleep health coach, providing personalized recommendations on sleep hygiene and habits to improve students' sleep quality and academic performance. The model should use clustering or classification techniques to categorize students based on their sleep patterns and academic performance, and then generate tailored advice to help each student achieve better sleep health and potentially enhance their academic outcomes

You can access a dataset **(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/cmusleep?select=cmu-sleep.csv)** containing students' detailed sleep and academic  performance records. The dataset includes:
- Sleep Data:
   - Average sleep duration per night
   - Bedtime and wake-up time
   - Sleep consistency (e.g., variability in sleep schedule)
   - Sleep quality ratings (e.g., subjective assessments of sleep quality)
   - Naps taken during the day
- Academic Data:
  - Grade Point Average (GPA)
  - Academic performance in various subjects
  - Study hours per week
  - Participation in extracurricular activities
- Additional Data (if available):
  - Stress levels
  - Physical activity levels
  - Dietary habits
