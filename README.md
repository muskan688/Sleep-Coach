# Sleep Coach – Predicting Academic Performance Based on Sleep Patterns

Overview

The Sleep Coach project is a machine learning-based application designed to analyze sleep patterns and predict student GPA. By leveraging regression models, it provides insights into how sleep habits impact academic performance.

Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleans, encodes, and scales sleep-related and demographic data.
- Feature Engineering: Uses key sleep metrics like Total Sleep Time, Midpoint Sleep, and Daytime Sleep.
- Model Training: Implements Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes models using GridSearchCV for improved accuracy.
- Performance Evaluation: Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) & R² Score to assess model effectiveness.
- Deployment: Provides a Streamlit-based web app for real-time GPA prediction.

Tech Stack
